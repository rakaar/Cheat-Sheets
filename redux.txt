		reducer takes two arguments
		state: the state in react 
		
		store:
		import { CreateStore } from 'redux'
		const initialState={
			name:'kaushik',
			age:19
		}
		const store = createStore(reducer,initialState)


		action:	dispatching of this action is going to update the state in 			store, 
				action is an object... thats it
				{
					type :'DO_SOMETHINHG',
					payload: {
						name:'kaushik',
						age:'19'
					}
				}

				note:   type is a compulsory argument and keeping it in 			capital letters is a popular practice

						payload is not compulsory but it is a popular practice to keep things in payload

		const reducer = (state,action) => {
			if(action.type=='TYPE-1') {
				//do x;
				return state
			}

			else if (action.type =='TYPE-2'){
